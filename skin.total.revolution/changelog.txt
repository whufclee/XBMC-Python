(v.0.2.4): Big Changes done whilst on holiday with no internet access, hence one giant commit rather than lots of small ones

Shortcuts:
- Changed size and layout so it's more obvious which is being selected
- 20 shortcuts can be added on each section (9 visible on screen without scrolling)
- User can give a custom name and custom icon for each shortcut
- Super Favourites set can be used as the default for every section
- User can select any shortcut set to use for each section
- Shortcut sets for EVERY section can be made as well as 6 new custom shortcut sets

Recently Added:
- If recently added scripts are selected as well as custom icon overlays the Recently Added widget
will take preference and icons will not be used on the same page as the RA widget as it looks messy.
- Choose between Music, Movies & TV Shows RA on every section of the homepage

Navigation Bar:
- TotalXBMC maintenance link added to top of bar, this can be hidden via settings. User can access
all sorts of shortcuts from here such as Total Installer, skin settings etc.
- Search box can use either Global Search or iSearch (from Super Favourites). Choose in settings

Settings:
- Copied Ronie's brilliant Transparency! skin settings over (Need to create some new icons)
- Created custom xml files so each section of the navbar has it's very own window of settings

Background:
- Custom Icons can selected for any navbar section
- Custom Backgrounds can be selected for any navbar section
- Global Background can be selected (Needs fixing)H

IP Address:
- Added an IP Address lookup to show on homepage, This can be enabled/disabled in settings. Shows to right of
RSS feed which has been made a little shorter and also removed the RSS icon.

Sub-Menus:
- Any sub-menu set can be used for any section on the homepage
- (WIP) Ability to customise each sub-menu


Other ToDo Items:
- Have the option to make custom overlay icons act as a button and open a favourite
- Option to lower the Navigation Bar like in Aeon skins (would probably require shortcuts to be disabled or maybe
have first sub-menu item to be "shortcuts" and if selected it moves the bar up so there's room)
- Option to choose the Navigation Bar artwork
- Option to choose the colour of the Homepage fonts
