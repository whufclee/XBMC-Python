v.1.0:
- Initial version

Instructions:
Go to your kodi folder and remove anything you don't want to include in the keyword.
We recommend deleting packages, addon_data (unless your planning on using it for addon fixes),
thumbnails and databases are useless and can certainly come out too.

Once you're happy with the contents of your kodi folder you can zip up the CONTENTS of the
kodi folder (not the actual folder itself but the contents) and then upload to somewhere like
copy.com or archive.org.

Once uploaded grab the final resolved download URL, this URL must start immediately downloading
if you enter it into a web browser. If there are any buttons you need to press to start the
download then right click on these and copy the link from the relevant download button.

Go to http://urlshortbot.com
Paste your download URL you just copied
In the keyword section type noobs<your_keyword>

As an example if you wanted to create a keyword for a disney artwork pack you could do:
noobsdisney
With the above keyword the end user would just type in disney, the noobs part is not used in kodi.
