v.2.0.3:
- New startup options, a great setup solution for noobs who don't venture into the settings.
- Better integration with MetalliQ, should no longer be any crashes.
- Fixed UK listings and added Irish to the options.
- Fixed the scanning of online and local xml files, now works with webgrab++, zap2xml and mc2xml.

v.2.0:

- Auto grabbing of channel data now available to NaN members (US & UK currently very good and well organised)
- Added back the option for ini file downloads as we have a great idea for that coming up :)

- Added brand new awesome metalliq functions:
--- First of all make sure you already have your channels scanned in
--- Open Metalliq add-on (min. v1.5) and install the relevant players via the totalsetup.
--- Go to TVP settings and login with your NaN login details
--- Enable the ini sync option
--- In the Super Favourite section (next tab) choose the SF folder you want to use for your live tv
--- Make sure the metalliq option is ticked (it's on by default) then press the option to scan in your content.
    This will scan what channels you have and create folders for them. You'll have the normal SF folders for each channel
    and if you want to continue using this method you can - just disable the metalliq option. However the metalliq option
    really is awesome... It creates a SF folder for each of your channels and populates those SF folders with links to
    each of the players you have installed for metalliq live tv. Click on one and if it fails to play you'll get a red cross
    to signify that player didn't work last time you tried, if it works you'll get a green + sign.

-- New donator option, a little gift for users that have made donations on the NaN forum. You can now run a second instance of TVP which has all the latest development updates.
   The donator versions are bleeding edge so there may well be some bugs, however you can switch between test version and stable version at the click of a button (in settings).

-- Scanning of XML files now done using RegEx rather than Elementtree, surprisingly it's MUCH faster and should also work on all platforms.
-- Added support for more XML compatibility, not found any online sources that fail to import on this update.
-- Far better meta and metaliq integration which allows for catchup or live options - will search your addons for the program title or the channel name.
-- Option to automatically add any SF folders that have a valid favourites.xml even if you have no EPG data. These will be added as dummy channels at the bottom of the EPG but can be moved.
-- Added option in settings to create a SYNC backup. This is used for the sync feature so you can synchronise multiple installs.
-- Scanning listings now adds a country code and cleans up the channel names. No more duplicate channels for different countries (MTV as an example).
-- Logos can now be automatically renamed using TVP tools, you only need one logo for each channel regardless of country.
-- Fixed touch screen setting, now only shows program/channel art if touch settings are off. If they are enabled the touch controls appear instead.
-- Re-written a lot of the startup code, it's now much faster at loading
-- (Hopefully) fixed problem with losing customisations after new listing import
-- Changed the misleading default message from "Listings coming soon" to "No information available"
-- Skin update, old ones will most likely not work - ask on forum if you need help with skinning
-- Included more icons (many need renaming). Thanks to jj_jake and icannuck.
-- Option in settings to use the nan categories and also the nan channel ordering. This will copy over the cats.xml and chan.xml files that we have been maintaining.
